In my work at Outlier AI, I focus on prompt review and prompt improvement, ensuring that our generative AI systems are as efficient and effective as possible. As a freelancer, I also contribute to prompt engineering, where I analyze and refine prompts to enhance the quality of AI outputs, using JavaScript and Python to implement and optimize solutions.
> “Prompt engineering is not just about crafting inputs, it’s about guiding AI to unlock its full potential.”

My role involves continuous learning and collaboration with a diverse team of experts, allowing me to stay at the forefront of AI development. I’m excited to be part of this journey, helping build smarter AI systems that can revolutionize industries and create new opportunities.
