During my studies, I focused on mastering web development, with an emphasis on Next.js and TypeScript. I developed a strong understanding of building scalable, dynamic web applications, using Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient routing, while TypeScript helped improve code quality and maintainability.

Additionally, I expanded my skills in cloud computing through Coursera courses, learning how to integrate cloud services into applications to create secure and scalable solutions. These experiences have equipped me to build advanced web applications that leverage modern frameworks and cloud infrastructure.
